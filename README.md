# Resolution Assistant

## Inspiration

Around more than 80% of New Year goals fail after just one month. We wanted to help people to achieve their goals by providing a tool that helps them to keep track of their progress and to get motivated so they will get a reward for their progress. As Discord is a very popular platform for youngsters, we decided to create a Discord bot that helps people to achieve their goals. Discord has gain over 250 million users in 2020 and is still growing. We believe that our bot will help people to achieve their goals and get motivated.

## What it does

The discord bot has the following features:

- `/new_year_resolution`: The bot will ask you to enter the resolution and the reward you will get for achieving the resolution.
- `/list`: The bot will list all the resolutions and the reward you will get for achieving the resolution.
- `/delete`: The bot will ask you to enter the resolution you want to delete.
- `/update`: The bot will ask you to enter the resolution you want to update and the new resolution.
- `/suggest`: The bot will ask you to enter the resolution you want to get suggestions for.
- `/goal_achieved`: The bot will ask you to enter the resolution you have achieved.
- `/eco_points`: The bot will list all the resolutions you have achieved and the eco points you have achieved.
- `/remind_me`: The bot will ask you to enter the resolution you want to set a reminder for and the date you want to be reminded.
- `/redeem: The bot will ask you to enter the reward you want to redeem and the eco points you want to redeem.

## How we built it

- **Python**: We used Python to create the discord bot.
- **GPT-3**: For getting suggestions for a resolution.
- **Hedera Hashgraph**: Storing the user's data in a decentralized way.

## Best Sustainability Hack sponsored by Avanade

We are awarding users `eco-points` for every sustainable action they take. The user can redeem these points for rewards. This will help the user to get motivated to take sustainable actions as well as help the environment. The user can redeem the points for rewards like NFTs, plant a Tree, etc. 

## Best Blockchain Project Using Hedera

We are using Hedera Hashgraph to store the user's data in a decentralized way. We are using Hedera Hashgraph because it is a fast, secure, and decentralized platform. 

## Challenges we ran into

- Because we had to implement the project by a certain date, finishing the project was difficult.
- I had to learn how to use GPT-3 and Hedera Hashgraph.
- I had to learn how to create a discord bot.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- I was pleased that I was able to learn how to use GPT-3 and Hedera Hashgraph.
- I was pleased that I was able to create a discord bot.

## What we learned

- I learned how to use GPT-3.
- I learned how to create a discord bot.

## What's next for Resolution Assistant

- I want to add more commands to the discord bot.
- Adding custom model for suggestions.
- Adding more rewards for the users.
